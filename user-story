Hey! My name is Michelle Cherister. I am a single mother and have a lot of trouble finding food in the neighborhood I live in; besides fast food chain restaurants. 
I fear for my kids growing obese and my family has a history of diabetes. I want to be able to see the nearest healthy restaurants such as 
Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, so that my family and the families in my neighborhood will no longer have to settle for cheap unhealthy food.
